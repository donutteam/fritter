## 2.0.0

* Removed the NoticeMiddleware.
* Removed the RenderComponentMiddleware.
* Removed the `@donutteam/document-builder` peer dependency.
* Removed the `FritterMiddlewareFunction` type.
* Updated most other dependencies.
	* Notably did *not* update `path-to-regexp` as I cannot currently be bothered to figure out the v7.0.0 changes.

## 1.4.0

* Made the RouterMiddleware's `Route` interface generic, allowing you to pass in a `FritterContext` type.
	* This is optional and the type defaults to the RouterMiddleware's `MiddlewareFritterContext` type.
* Renamed `FritterMiddlewareFunction` to `MiddlewareFunction`.
	* The old name is still available for now but marked as deprecated.

## 1.3.0
Renamed `CurrentPage` middleware to `CurrentPageNumber`. The old name is still available for now.

The middleware's context also now contains a `currentPageNumber` property in addition to the now deprecated `currentPage` property.

## 1.2.1

* Fixed various mistakes in the `CurrentPage` middleware.

## 1.2.0

* Added `CurrentPage` middleware.
* Added `Notice` middleware.

## 1.1.1

* Re-added `routes` to `CreateOptions` for Router middleware. Didn't mean to make a breaking change.
* Made `CreateOptions` for Router middleware optional.

## 1.1.0
Added `getRoutes`, `loadRoutesFile`, `loadRoutesDirectory`, and `remoteRoute` functions to the `CreateResult` for the `RouterMiddleware`.

## 1.0.2
Made `CreateOptions` optional for the `BodyParser`, `Cors`, `ForceSsl` and `LogRequest` middlewares.

## 1.0.1
Fixed a mistake where the `main` path in `package.json` was incorrect.

## 1.0.0

This is a quite significant rewrite from the previous version. It also bundles common middlewares to simplify the usage of the library.

Updated packages.

## 0.1.8

## 0.1.5
Added the `src` folder to the published package for better developer experience.

## 0.1.4
Changed `Fritter.use` to accept any type of `FritterMiddlewareFunction`.

Removed `FritterMiddleware` class as it just complicated things too much and was also too opinionated.

Made `FritterMiddlewareFunction` optionally generic.

## 0.1.1
Removed the generic `state` property from `FritterContext`.

## 0.1.0
Initial alpha release.
