# Fritter
Fritter is a web framework for Node.js built with TypeScript to make it simple and fast to write web applications and APIs.

Inspired by Koa, Fritter provides many of the same features while removing much of the ambiguity and providing type safety.

It also comes bundled with several (optional) middlewares that cover various common use cases such as routing and serving static assets.

This library is mostly intended for use by Donut Team's web services, but it is open source and can be used by anyone who finds it useful.

## Installation
Fritter is tested against the LTS version of Node.js. It may work in earlier versions, but we cannot offer any guarantees.

```
npm install @donutteam/fritter
```
