## Fritter
An HTTP middleware framework for Node.js built with TypeScript to make it simple and fast to write web applications and APIs.

Inspired by Koa, Fritter provides many of the same features while removing much of the ambiguity and providing type safety.

## Installation
Fritter is tested against the LTS version of Node.js. It may work in earlier versions but we cannot offer any guarantees.

```
npm install @fritter/core
```

## Usage
This package is currently in **Alpha** (versions < 1.0.0) and is subject to change at any time.

Documentation will be added as the API stabilizes.
